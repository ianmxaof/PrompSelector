# Prompt Selector

Prompt Selector is a tray-based, hotkey-powered prompt command suite — built for serious AI operators, not tourists.

## ⚙️ What It Does
- Instantly launch prompts via custom hotkeys
- Organize prompts by category, topic, tag, and use-case
- Track versions, edits, and changelogs automatically
- Export prompt packs in JSON/CSV for backups or distribution
- Switch between local, encrypted, or synced cloud vaults
- Full GUI overlay + tray menu for fast access

## 🧨 Why It Exists
The prompt marketplace is heading toward collapse. Everyone's selling slightly tweaked versions of the same 50 templates.

That’s not scalable. That’s not infrastructure.

> Prompt Selector turns *one-off prompts* into *programmable weapons*. Think command-line meets UX, for LLM workflows.

It’s designed for:
- Power users juggling multiple LLMs
- Agents and bots that require prompt injection
- Builders tired of clicking through bloated interfaces

## 🧠 The Philosophy
Prompts aren’t static. They evolve, mutate, and specialize.

Prompt Selector is built on 3 core beliefs:
1. Prompts are operations, not content
2. Prompt strategy should be modular and tracked
3. The future isn’t buying prompts — it’s *operating them better*

## 🛣️ Roadmap
- 🔗 API hooks for cloud prompt access & sync
- 📈 Prompt performance analytics (by output, rating, etc)
- 🧠 AI suggestions for optimizing + chaining prompts
- 🧩 Plugin architecture for LangGraph, AutoGen, etc
- 💼 Monetizable prompt packs for creators
- 🧱 Fully self-hostable or SaaS-optional deployment

## 🧰 Part of the GodMode Suite
Prompt Selector is one of many utilities in the **GodMode Suite** — a ruthless automation ecosystem for builders who actually ship:

- Terminal GodMode Installer (autoinstalls your stack)
- Auto Git Sync for AI projects
- File Watchers + PromptOps for LLMs
- Soon: Agent Layer, Market Tap, and ScriptMancer

## 🤝 Let’s Collaborate
If you're building the *infra* behind the AI wave — not just wrappers — let’s talk.

> Prompt Selector is for the ones building beyond the hype.
